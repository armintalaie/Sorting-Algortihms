# Sorting-Algortihms


## QuickSort 

Sorts array by splitting it into 2 partitions one contains only smaller and the other only greater elements than the pivot. The pivot can be any element in the array such as first, last, median and random. When the splitting ends the array is fully sorted.
- If the pivot is chosen randomly the running time is vastly improved for and average running time of (nlogn)
- Another advantage of QuickSort is the fact that the array is sorted in place by just switching elements in it and it doesn't need a copy array to sort.
